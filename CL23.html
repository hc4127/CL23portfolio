              NYU Abu Dhabi's breathtaking campus seamlessly blends modernity with tradition, nestled on Saadiyat Island's pristine shores. Its stunning architecture features sleek, contemporary buildings that harmoniously coexist with lush green spaces and traditional Arabian design elements. This vibrant academic oasis fosters global perspectives, offering state-of-the-art facilities, a diverse student body, and a rich cultural tapestry. The purpose of the project is to showcase the 30MFF video we made a few weeks ago. The general concept is a site that welcomes freshmen and newcomers to NYUAD, giving them some resources to navigate the campus.

              Humans have explored 5% of Earth's Oceans, what have we found so far? This website will let the user submerge a submarine into the ocean manually, then control the submarine using scrolling. The submarine will then follow the user as they scroll down. Occasionally, photos accompanied by infographics in the form of comics will pop up about deep sea creatures like the elbow squid, telescope fish, etc. As the user scrolls down, there will be fish swimming in the background. This project is a group assignment but I did this project alone because I was bedridden with influenza and then pneumonia for two weeks and missed a lot of class and was rendered unable to work. That was not fun.

              A Grand Heist in Downtown Harlem Gone Wrong. The user is put into the role of Investigator Jameson and will be prompted to listen to three audio recordings, each with a different testimony from three accomplices of the heist: the Lookout, the Insider, and the Muscle. The project is based on Rashomon, an old Japanese mystery movie based on an even older Japanese mystery novel. Rashomon is famous for never giving the audience an answer, leaving only the testimonies of several witnesses and suspects to piece together the puzzle which has no answer.
