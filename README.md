# Video Project Name
Communications Lab Final Portfolio

### Project Description
This is a compilation of all the big projects I've done this year. This includes the 30MFF Video Project, the Interactive Comic Project, the Audio Project, and of course, the Video Project. I decided to not include the smaller assignments but I might change my mind on that.

### Process & Reflection
I had a lot of fun making this website. It's not extremely fancy in the programming department, but I think it looks pretty decent design-wise. I was pretty sick right after I finished my video project so I had to do this while I had a fever. I still powered through though. This semester has been really fun because of comms lab constantly pushing me to be more creative and do things that I might not try to learn without having it assigned to me. I'm proud of all the assignments I've cranked out this semester.
